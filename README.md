Introduction

This project will load the data from the FBI NICS database as well as data from the U.S. Census. Both tables will be wrangled and cleaned up in the following section to analyze how many background checks were done per capita for each state. The first two graphs in the exploratory section will graph the relationship between population and background checks for each state regarding all background checks and background checks done excluding permit checks. The final two bar graphs will illustrate the top twenty states that have the highest per capita background checks with and without permit background checks. The reason for the two graphs is that Kentucky is the only state that does repeated permit background checks once a month for any person that has a carry permit. The first bar graph will show Kentucky being the highest per capita because of this.
